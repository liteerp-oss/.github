# LiteERP

**LiteERP** is a lightweight, modular, open-source ERP designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).

## Why LiteERP?

Most ERP systems today are powerful — but also heavy, complex, and expensive to maintain.  
LiteERP focuses on what really matters:

- ⚡ Lightweight & fast (runs smoothly on 2GB RAM)
- 🧱 Clean Architecture with a solid, protected core
- 🪝 Extension-first & hook-based customization
- 🔄 Decoupled modules that can be installed or removed safely
- 📦 Built for real-world SME workflows

## Philosophy

> ERP should adapt to the business — not force the business to adapt to ERP.

LiteERP is built with long-term maintainability, clarity, and developer experience in mind.
